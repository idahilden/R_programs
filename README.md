# R_programs

Programs created as part of the course STK2100: Machine Learning and Statistical Methods for Prediction and Classification at the University of Oslo.

Covers topics such as:
- linear regression
- variable transformations, multivariate outcome and computational aspects
- likelihood, logistic regression and GLM (generalized linear model)
- optimism, overfitting and bias-variance trade-off
- cross-validation and information-based criteria (AIC and BIC)
- variable selection methods and principal components
- regularized regression; lasso, ridge and KNN (k-nearest neighbour)
- kernels methods, curse of dimensionality and splines 
- smoothing splines, additive models, GAM and projection pursuit
- classification, performance evaluation, multivariate logistic models, classification via linear models and discriminant analysis
- regularized approches for classification and regression trees
- classification trees, neural networks and support vector machines
- unsupervised learning and dissimilarity
- non-hirarchical clustering and hierarchical clustering
